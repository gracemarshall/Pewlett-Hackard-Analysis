The objective of this analysis is for Bobby to use SQL and provide his manager with the following reports;
* The number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentor-ship program. 
* Report summary analysis for the manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
 
 ## Data Process
* data modeling by creating a schema that was mapped out the table on the database on how the tables will interact with each other.  
* CSV files of the company was imported into the database. Data type, primary keys, foreign keys were established with restriction to maintain data integrity. 
* SQL was used to communicate with database to import and transform the data in the database using filters, groupings, joins, and generating custom tables.
